Q6. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
Ans. To un-stage changes from staged area, we can use reset command: git reset <file_name> or we can use restore command to unstage the file: git restore --staged <filename> and incase
we want to discard the local changes then we just have to remove --staged from above command.
